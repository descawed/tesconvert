# tesconvert
A tool for converting player characters between The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion

This tool is still in very early development and is not suitable for general use. The tesutil crate is designed in a way that it could be used as a general Rust library for
working with TES3/TES4 plugin files and saves, but the API is *not* stable and will likely change significantly as tesconvert approaches 1.0.
